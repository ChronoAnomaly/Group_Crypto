We will need to change the code to have it save the keys to a location and allow it
to fetch a public key from a server to encrypt the data with.

Look through the code and make sure to understand it.  If you want to make changes, create a new branch to later merge
with the master branch.

To run as currently implemented
-------------------------------
The RSATest class must be run with the command line arguments with 'plaintext' 'destination'.
