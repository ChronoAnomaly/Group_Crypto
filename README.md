To run as currently implemented
-------------------------------
The EncryptionUtil class is set to run with the command line. It will need to have two arguments passed to it in the
form of: command fileName.

The commands are : encrypt, decrypt

The file that is named must be placed inside of the project folder and once the command is run on it, it will
be placed in the keys folder by default
